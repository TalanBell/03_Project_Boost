# Project Boost

A 2D/3D game based on an old game where the only controls are rotate left and right, and rocket boost. Get across the screen, avoiding walls and obstacles, to complete the level.

Following the Udemy/GameDev.tv course 'Complete C# Unity Developer'. (v number is video/lecture number on Udemy course)
## Changes
* v40 - Making launchpad, terrain, camera view, lighting direction, prefabbing all.
* v41 - Basic placeholder art with primitives
* v43 - Physics & Rigidbodies (and v42 basic input binding)
* v44 - Adding in rotation (but not frame-rate independence yet)
* v47 - Adding a touch of audio (and trying out chicken model instead of rocket)
